# Battleship Game

A browser-based Battleship game in vanilla JavaScript using TDD. Play against a computer with classic rules: 10x10 grid, ships cannot touch or overlap, player continues after a hit. Computer AI targets adjacent cells after a hit and avoids duplicate shots. Ships and attacks are validated for board boundaries and duplicates. When a ship is sunk, surrounding cells are auto-marked as misses. Game over overlay and restart included.
